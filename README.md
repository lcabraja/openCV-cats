# JAVA2 Project - Detection of cat faces in images using ML
## Algebra University College | Semester 5

### Langauge + Libraries
Java
JavaFX
OpenCV

### ML
Utilizes example HAAR and LPB Cascade Classifiers from the OpenCV Java library

### Principle
The host (server) is the first instance that happens to occupy the required ports and devices.
Each subsequent instance defines itself as the client, and will ping the server for lists of files and images in order to process them (run them through the cascade to detect faces of cats)

### TODO
- Neutral
  - [ ] Displaying a results as done
  - [x] Settings pane
- Server
  - [x] Sharing directories
  - [ ] Receiving results
- Client
  - [x] Storing directory structure
  - [ ] Sending results

This project will not be iterated further.
